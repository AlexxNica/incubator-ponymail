# AAA Examples
This directory contains example AAA libraries for various use cases

### AAA by email address:
[`aaa_by_email_address.lua`](aaa_by_email_address.lua) checks against a GLOB
(`valid_email`), and if a logged-in user's email address matches this, provides
access to private lists, provided the OAuth provider used is listed in
`config.lua` as a valid authority.
